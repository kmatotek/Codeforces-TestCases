# Problem Description

For a multiset $$$T$$$ consisting of non-negative integers, we define:

Find the maximum possible score that can be obtained.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 50$$$).
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n$$$ ($$$0 \le S_i \le 50$$$).

## Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum possible score that can be obtained.
