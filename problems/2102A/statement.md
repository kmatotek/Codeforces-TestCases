# Problem Description

Given four integersn,m,p, andq, determine whether there exists an integer arraya1,a2,…,an(elements may be negative) satisfying the following conditions:

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four integersn,m,p, andq(1≤p≤n≤100,1≤q,m≤100) — the length of the array, the sum of elements, the length of a segment, and the sum of a segment, respectively.

## Output
For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if there exists an array satisfying the above conditions, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yES", "yes", and "Yes" will all be recognized as valid responses).
