# Problem Description

Ecrade has an integer $$$x$$$. He will show you this number in the form of a binary number of length $$$n$$$.
There are two kinds of operations.
Ecrade will perform several operations until $$$x$$$ becomes $$$1$$$. Each time, he will independently choose to perform either the first operation or the second operation with probability $$$\frac{1}{2}$$$.
Ecrade wants to know the expected number of operations he will perform to make $$$x$$$ equal to $$$1$$$, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him!

## Input
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$x$$$ in binary representation.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string of length $$$n$$$: the number $$$x$$$ in the binary representation, presented from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. It is guaranteed that the most significant bit of $$$x$$$ is $$$1$$$.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, print a single integer representing the expected number of operations Ecrade will perform to make $$$x$$$ equal to $$$1$$$, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.
Formally, let $$$M = 10^9+7$$$. It can be shown that the exact answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \le x < M$$$ and $$$x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}$$$.
