# Problem Description

You are the proud owner ofnsticks. Each stick has an integer length from1ton. The lengths of the sticks aredistinct.
You want to arrange the sticks in a row. There is a stringsof lengthn−1that describes the requirements of the arrangement.
Specifically, for eachifrom1ton−1:
Find any valid arrangement of sticks. We can show that an answer always exists.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤500). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integern(2≤n≤100) — the number of sticks.
The second line of each test case contains a single stringsof lengthn−1consisting of characters<and>— describing the requirements of the arrangement.

## Output
For each test case, outputnintegersa1,a2,…,an(1≤ai≤n, theaiare distinct) — the lengths of the sticks in order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
