# Problem Description


For an undirected connected graph of $$$n$$$ vertices, where the $$$i$$$-thvertexhas a weight of $$$v_i$$$, we define thevalueof a simple path$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_m$$$ as $$$v_{l_1}\oplus v_{l_2}\oplus\cdots\oplus v_{l_m}$$$$$$^{\text{†}}$$$. We call the graphbalancedif and only if:
Aquawave has given you an undirected connected graph of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges, and the $$$i$$$-th vertex in the graph has a weight of $$$a_i$$$. However, some of the weights are missing, represented by $$$-1$$$.
Aquawave wants to assign an integer weight between $$$0$$$ and $$$V-1$$$ to each vertex with $$$a_i=-1$$$, so that the graph will bebalanced.
You have to help Aquawave find the number of ways to assign weights to achieve the goal, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A simple path from $$$c$$$ to $$$d$$$ is a sequence of vertices $$$l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_m$$$, where $$$l_1=c$$$, $$$l_m=d$$$, such that there is an edge between $$$l_i$$$ and $$$l_{i+1}$$$ for every $$$1\le i\le m-1$$$, and there are no repeated vertices, i.e. $$$l_i\ne l_j$$$ for $$$1\le i<j\le n$$$.
$$$^{\text{†}}$$$$$$\oplus$$$ denotes thebitwise XOR operation.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$V$$$ ($$$2\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n-1\le m\le \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 4\cdot 10^5\right)$$$, $$$1\le V\le 10^9$$$) — the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the upper bound of weights.
The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-1\le a_i\le V-1$$$) — the weights of the vertices. $$$a_i=-1$$$ represents that the weight of the $$$i$$$-th vertex is missing.
Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th line containing two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1\le u,v\le n$$$) — the two vertices that the $$$i$$$-th edge connects.
It is guaranteed that the given graph is simple and connected.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$, and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4\cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of ways to assign weights to make the graphbalanced, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.
