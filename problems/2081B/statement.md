# Problem Description

Ecrade has an integer array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. It's guaranteed that for each $$$1 \le i < n$$$, $$$a_i \neq a_{i+1}$$$.
Ecrade can perform several operations on the array to make it strictly increasing.
In each operation, he can choose two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$) and replace $$$a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$$$ with any $$$r-l+1$$$ integers $$$a'_l, a'_{l+1}, \ldots, a'_r$$$ satisfying the following constraint:
Ecrade wants to know the minimum number of operations to make the array strictly increasing. However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him!

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).
It is guaranteed that for each $$$1 \le i< n$$$, $$$a_i \neq a_{i+1}$$$.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum number of operations to make the array strictly increasing.
