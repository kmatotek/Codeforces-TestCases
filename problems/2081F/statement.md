# Problem Description

Piggy Zhou loves matrices, especially those that make him get excited, calledhot matrix.
A hot matrix of sizen×ncan be defined as follows. Letai,jdenote the element in thei-th row,j-th column (1≤i,j≤n).
Now, Piggy Zhou gives you a numbern, and you need to provide him with a hot matrix if the hot matrix exists for the givenn, or inform him that he will never get excited if the hot matrix does not exist for the givenn.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤1000). The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains one integern(1≤n≤3000).
It is guaranteed that the sum ofnacross all test cases does not exceed3000.

## Output
For each test case, print "NO" (without quotes) if the hot matrix does not exist for the givenn.
Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes) on the first line. Then outputnrows, withnnumbers in each row, representing the hot matrix of sizen×nthat meets the requirements of the problem.
If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
