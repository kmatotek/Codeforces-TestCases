# Problem Description


You are given three non-negative integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ and $$$z$$$. Determine whether there exist three non-negative integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ satisfying the following three conditions:
where $$$\mathbin{\&}$$$ denotes thebitwise AND operation.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ and $$$z$$$ ($$$0\le x, y, z\le 10^9$$$) — the target values of $$$a \mathbin{\&} b$$$, $$$b \mathbin{\&} c$$$ and $$$a \mathbin{\&} c$$$, respectively.

## Output
For each test case, output "YES" if there exists three non-negative integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ satisfying the above conditions, and "NO" otherwise.
You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
