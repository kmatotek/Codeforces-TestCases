# Problem Description

You are given a complete graph with $$$n$$$ vertices, where the $$$i$$$-th vertex has a weight $$$p_i$$$. The weight of the edge connecting vertex $$$x$$$ and vertex $$$y$$$ is equal to $$$\operatorname{max}(p_x, p_y) \bmod \operatorname{min}(p_x, p_y)$$$.
Find the smallest total weight of a set of $$$n - 1$$$ edges that connect all $$$n$$$ vertices in this graph.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$).
The next line of each test contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$).
The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.
The sum of $$$\max(p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n)$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the weight of the minimum spanning tree.
