# Problem Description

The pink soldiers have given you4distinct pointson the plane. The4points' coordinates are(−l,0),(r,0),(0,−d),(0,u)correspondingly, wherel,r,d,uare positive integers.
Please determine if it is possible to draw a square∗with the given points as its vertices.
∗Asquareis defined as a polygon consisting of4vertices, of which all sides have equal length and all inner angles are equal. No two edges of the polygon may intersect each other.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains four integersl,r,d,u(1≤l,r,d,u≤10).

## Output
For each test case, if you can draw a square using the four points, output "Yes". Otherwise, output "No".
You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", and "YES" will also be recognized as positive responses.
