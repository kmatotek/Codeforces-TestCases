# Problem Description


Kevin has an integer sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. At the same time, Kevin has $$$m$$$ types of magic, where the $$$i$$$-th type of magic can be represented by an integer $$$b_i$$$.
Kevin can perform at most $$$k$$$ (possibly zero) magic operations. In each operation, Kevin can do the following:
Find the minimum possible sum of all numbers in the sequence $$$a$$$ after performing at most $$$k$$$ operations.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n, m, k$$$ ($$$1\leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$1\leq m \leq 10$$$, $$$0\leq k\leq nm$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$, the number of types of magic, and the maximum number of operations.
The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\leq a_i < 2^{30}$$$).
The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$0\leq b_i < 2^{30}$$$).
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output one integer — the minimum possible sum of all numbers in the sequence $$$a$$$ after performing at most $$$k$$$ operations.
