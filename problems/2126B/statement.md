# Problem Description

You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ numbers and a number $$$k$$$. The value $$$a_i$$$ describes the weather on the $$$i$$$-th day: if it rains on the $$$i$$$-th day, then $$$a_i = 1$$$; otherwise, if the weather is good on the $$$i$$$-th day, then $$$a_i = 0$$$.
Jean wants to visit as many peaks as possible. One hike to a peak takes exactly $$$k$$$ days, and during each of these days, the weather must be good ($$$a_i = 0$$$). That is, formally, he can start a hike on day $$$i$$$ only if all $$$a_j = 0$$$ for all $$$j$$$ $$$(i \leq j \leq i + k - 1)$$$.
After each hike, before starting the next one, Jean must take a break of at least one day, meaning that on the day following a hike, he cannot go on another hike.
Find the maximum number of peaks that Jean can visit.

## Input
Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le k \le n$$$).
The second line contains $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$a_i \in \{0, 1\}$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ denotes the weather on the $$$i$$$-th day.
It is guaranteed that the total value of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of hikes that Jean can make.
