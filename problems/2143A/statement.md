# Problem Description


You are given a permutation$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$.
You must perform exactly one operation for each integer $$$k$$$ from 1 up to $$$n$$$ in that order:
After completing all $$$n$$$ operations, your goal is to have all elements of the array equal to zero.
Determine whether it is possible to achieve this.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).
$$$^{\text{†}}$$$An array $$$a$$$ is a subarray of an array $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line contains the value $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 100$$$) — the length of the permutation.
The second line contains $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$) — the permutation itself.

## Output
For each test case, outputYESif it is possible to make all elements of the array $$$p$$$ equal to $$$0$$$ after performing all the operations; otherwise, outputNO.
You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
