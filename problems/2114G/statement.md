# Problem Description

Yesterday, Dima found an empty array and decided to add some integers to it. He can perform the following operation an unlimited number of times:
It can be shown that there can be at most one such pair in the array at the same time.
For example, if the array is $$$[3, 6, 4]$$$ and we add the number $$$3$$$ to the left, the array will first become $$$[3, 3, 6, 4]$$$, then the first two elements will be replaced by $$$6$$$, and the array will become $$$[6, 6, 4]$$$, and then — $$$[12, 4]$$$.
After performing the operationexactly$$$k$$$ times, he thinks he has obtained an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, but he does not remember which operations he applied. Determine if there exists a sequence of $$$k$$$ operations that could result in the given array $$$a$$$ from an empty array, or determine that it is impossible.

## Input
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case description contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$n \le k \le 10^6$$$) — the length of the resulting array and the number of operations.
The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9, a_{i - 1} \ne a_i$$$) — the elements of the resulting array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, if there is no suitable sequence of operations of length $$$k$$$, output "NO". Otherwise, output "YES".
You may output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).
