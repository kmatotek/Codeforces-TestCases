# Problem Description

Pasha loves prime numbers∗! Once again, in his attempts to find a new way to generate prime numbers, he became interested in an algorithm he found on the internet:
For example, forx=52andk=3, we gety=525252, and forx=6andk=7, we gety=6666666.
Pasha really wants the resulting numberyto be prime, but he doesn't yet know how to check the primality of numbers generated by this algorithm. Help Pasha and tell him whetheryis prime!
∗An integerxis considered prime if it hasexactly2distinct divisors:1andx. For example,13is prime because it has only2divisors:1and13. Note that the number1is not prime, as it has only one divisor.

## Input
Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a single integert(1≤t≤100) — the number of sets of input data. The following lines describe the sets of input data.
The first and only line of each data set contains two integers:xandk(1≤x≤109,1≤k≤7).

## Output
For each set of input data, output«YES»(without quotes) if the resulting numberywill be prime, and«NO»otherwise.
You may output«Yes»and«No»in any case (for example, the strings«yES»,«yes», and«Yes»will be recognized as positive answers).
