# Problem Description


You are given three integersn,m, andk, wherem⋅k<n.
For a sequencebconsisting of non-negative integers, definef(b)as follows:
You need to construct a sequenceaof lengthnconsisting of non-negative integers, such that:
∗The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integersc1,c2,…,ckis defined as the smallest non-negative integerxwhich does not occur in the collectionc.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three integersn,m, andk(2≤n≤2⋅105,1≤m<n,1≤k<n,1≤m⋅k<n).
It is guaranteed that the sum ofnover all test cases does not exceed2⋅105.

## Output
For each test case, outputnintegersa1,a2,…,an(0≤ai≤109).
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
