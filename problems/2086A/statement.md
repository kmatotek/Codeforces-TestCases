# Problem Description

The most valuable berry of the Karelian forests is cloudberry. To make jam from cloudberries, you take equal amounts of berries and sugar and cook them. Thus, if you have2kg of berries, you need2kg of sugar. However, from2kg of berries and2kg of sugar, you will not get4kg of jam, as one might expect, but only3kg, since some of the jam evaporates during cooking. Specifically, during standard cooking, exactly a quarter (or25%) of the jam evaporates.
How many kilograms of cloudberries are needed to preparen3-kilogram jars of jam?

## Input
Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integert(1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases.
Each test case contains a single integern(1≤n≤108) — the number of jars of jam that need to be prepared.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the amount of berries needed for the jam in kilograms.
