# Problem Description

Kamilka has a flock ofnsheep, thei-th of which has a beauty level ofai. Allaiare distinct. Morning has come, which means they need to be fed. Kamilka can choose a non-negative integerdand give each sheepdbunches of grass. After that, the beauty level of each sheep increases byd.
In the evening, Kamilka must chooseexactly twosheep and take them to the mountains. If the beauty levels of these two sheep arexandy(after they have been fed), then Kamilka'spleasurefrom the walk is equal togcd(x,y), wheregcd(x,y)denotes thegreatest common divisor (GCD)of integersxandy.
The task is to find the maximum possible pleasure that Kamilka can get from the walk.

## Input
Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains one integert(1≤t≤500), the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integern(2≤n≤100), the number of sheep Kamilka has.
The second line of each test case containsndistinctintegersa1,a2,…,an(1≤ai≤109)— the beauty levels of the sheep.
It is guaranteed that allaiare distinct.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible pleasure that Kamilka can get from the walk.
