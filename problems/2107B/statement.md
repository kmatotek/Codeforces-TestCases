Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integersn,k(2≤n≤105,1≤k≤109).
The second line of each test case containsnintegersa1,a2,…,an(1≤ai≤109).
It is guaranteed that the sum ofnover all test cases does not exceed105.

## Output
