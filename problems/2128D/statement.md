# Problem Description


You're given a permutation$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p_1, \ldots, p_n$$$ such that $$$\max(p_i, p_{i+1}) > p_{i+2}$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n-2$$$.
Compute the sum of the length of the longest decreasing subsequence$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of the subarray $$$[p_l, p_{l+1}, \ldots, p_r]$$$ over all pairs $$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).
$$$^{\text{†}}$$$Given an array $$$b$$$ of size $$$|b|$$$, a decreasing subsequence of length $$$k$$$ is a sequence of indices $$$i_1, \ldots, i_k$$$ such that:

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10\,000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n \leq 500\,000$$$).
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$, $$$p_i$$$ are pairwise distinct).
It is guaranteed that $$$\max(p_i, p_{i+1}) > p_{i+2}$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n-2$$$.
The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500\,000$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output the sum over all subarrays of the length of its longest decreasing subsequence.
