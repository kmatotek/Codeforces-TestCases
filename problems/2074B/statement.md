# Problem Description

The pink soldiers have given you a sequenceaconsisting ofnpositive integers.
You must repeatedly perform the following operationuntil there is only1element left.
Please find the maximum possible value of the only last element in the sequencea.
∗A triangle with side lengthsa,b,cis non-degenerate whena+b>c,a+c>b,b+c>a.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integern(1≤n≤2⋅105).
The second line of each test case containsnintegersa1,a2,…,an(1≤ai≤1000) — the elements of the sequencea.
It is guaranteed that the sum ofnover all test cases does not exceed2⋅105.

## Output
For each test case, output the maximum possible value of the only last element on a separate line.
