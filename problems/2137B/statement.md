# Problem Description


You are given a permutation$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of size $$$n$$$.
Your task is to find a permutation $$$q$$$ of size $$$n$$$ such that $$$\operatorname{GCD}$$$$$$^{\text{†}}$$$$$$(p_i+q_i, p_{i+1}+q_{i+1}) \geq 3$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i<n$$$. In other words, the greatest common divisor of the sum of any two adjacent positions should be at least $$$3$$$.
It can be shown that this is always possible.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$m$$$ is an array consisting of $$$m$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$m=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).
$$$^{\text{†}}$$$$$$\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes thegreatest common divisor (GCD)of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$).
The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i \leq n$$$).
It is guaranteed that the given array forms a permutation.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output the permutation $$$q$$$ on a new line. If there are multiple possible answers, you may output any.
