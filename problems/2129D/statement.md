# Problem Description

For a permutation $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$, the corresponding coloring sequence $$$s$$$ can be obtained by the following coloring process:
After all cells are colored black, denoting $$$s_i$$$ as the score of cell $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$), we get the coloring sequence $$$s$$$.
You might want to read the notes for a better understanding.
You are given an incomplete coloring sequence $$$s$$$, where some $$$s_i$$$ are already fixed, while others are not yet determined. Count how many different permutations $$$p$$$ can produce this coloring sequence. Since the answer may be large, you need to output it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
For each test case, the first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 100$$$).
The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$$$ ($$$-1 \leq s_i \leq n-1$$$). Here, $$$s_i=-1$$$ means $$$s_i$$$ has not been determined. And $$$s_i \neq -1$$$ means $$$s_i$$$ has already been fixed.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output the total of different permutations $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ that can produce the coloring sequence, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.
