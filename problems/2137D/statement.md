# Problem Description

Given an array $$$a$$$, let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of occurrences of $$$x$$$ in the array $$$a$$$. For example, when $$$a=[1,2,3,1,4]$$$, then $$$f(1)=2$$$ and $$$f(3)=1$$$.
You have an array $$$b$$$ of size $$$n$$$. Please determine if there is an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ such that $$$f(a_i)=b_i$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$. If there is one, construct it.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$).
The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq b_i \leq n$$$).
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output $$$-1$$$ if there is no valid array $$$a$$$.
Otherwise, print the array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers on a new line. The elements should satisfy $$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$.
