# Problem Description

You are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers.
For every integer $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, you have to do the following:
For every $$$k$$$, you choose the element which you move so that the value you print isthe maximum possible.
Calculate the value you print for every $$$k$$$.

## Input
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines:
Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th of these integers should be equal to the maximum value you can print if $$$k=i$$$.
