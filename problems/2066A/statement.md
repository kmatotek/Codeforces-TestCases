# Problem Description


This is an interactive problem.
You are given an arrayx1,…,xnof integers from1ton. The jury also has a fixed but hidden arrayy1,…,ynof integers from1ton. The elements of arrayyareunknownto you. Additionally, it is known that for alli,xi≠yi, and all pairs(xi,yi)are distinct.
The jury has secretly thought of one of two objects, and you need to determine which one it is:
To guess which object the jury has thought of, you can make queries. In one query, you must specify two numbersi,j(1≤i,j≤n,i≠j). In response, you receive one number:
You have2queries to determine which of the objects the jury has thought of.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤1000). The description of the test cases follows.
