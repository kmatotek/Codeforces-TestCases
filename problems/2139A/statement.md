# Problem Description

Maple has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. She may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero) to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$:
Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$. It can be proven that this is always possible.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le 1000$$$) — the numbers Maple currently has.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum number of operations Maple needs to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$.
