# Problem Description

It is known that a contest can be represented by a string $$$s$$$, consisting of uppercase Latin letters that denote problems. It is also known that a contest is difficult if it contains "FFT" or "NTT" as a contiguous substring.
Your task is to rearrange the problem in contest $$$s$$$ in such a way that this contest is not difficult. If the initial contest is not difficult, you may leave it as it is.

## Input
Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^{4}$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^{5}$$$).
Additional constraints on the input data:

## Output
For each test case, output a string — a non-difficult contest that was obtained from $$$s$$$ by rearranging the letters.
If there are multiple correct answers, you may output any. It can be shown that at least one correct answer always exists.
