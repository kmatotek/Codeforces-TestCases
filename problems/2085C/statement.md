# Problem Description


You are given two positive integersxandy(1≤x,y≤109).
Find anon-negativeintegerk≤1018, such that(x+k)+(y+k)=(x+k)⊕(y+k)holds∗, or determine that such an integer does not exist.
∗⊕denotes thebitwise XOR operation.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integersxandy(1≤x,y≤109) — the given integers.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integerk(0≤k≤1018) — the integer you found. Print−1if it is impossible to find such an integer.
If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.
