# Problem Description

Yousef is at the entrance of a long hallway withndoors in a row, numbered from1ton. He needs to pass through all the doors from1tonin order of numbering and reach the exit (past doorn).
Each door can be open or closed. If a door is open, Yousef passes through it in1second. If the door is closed, Yousef can't pass through it.
However, Yousef has a special button which he can useat most onceat any moment. This button makes all closed doors become open forxseconds.
Your task is to determine if Yousef can pass through all the doors if he can use the button at most once.

## Input
The first line of the input contains an integert(1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integersn,x(1≤n,x≤10) — the number of doors and the number of seconds of the button, respectively.
The second line of each test case containsnintegersa1,a2,...,an(ai∈{0,1}) — the state of each door. Open doors are represented by'0', while closed doors are represented by'1'.
It is guaranteed that each test case contains at least one closed door.

## Output
For each test case, output "YES" if Yousef can reach the exit, and "NO" otherwise.
You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
