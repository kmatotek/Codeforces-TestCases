# Problem Description

We call a bitstring∗perfect if it has the same number of101and010subsequences†. Construct a perfect bitstring of lengthnwhere the number of1characters it contains is exactlyk.
It can be proven that the construction is always possible. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.
∗A bitstring is a string consisting only of the characters0and1.
†A sequenceais a subsequence of a stringbifacan be obtained frombby the deletion of several (possibly zero or all) characters.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤500). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integersnandk(1≤n≤100,0≤k≤n) — the size of the bitstring and the number of1characters in the bitstring.

## Output
For each test case, output the constructed bitstring. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.
