# Problem Description

An array $$$b$$$ isgoodif there do not exist indices $$$1 \leq i < j \leq |b|$$$ such that $$$b_j - b_i = 1$$$.
You are given an integer. array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. Determine theminimum number of elementsthat need to be removed from the given array so that it becomes a good array.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 6 \cdot 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$) — the elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it a good array.
