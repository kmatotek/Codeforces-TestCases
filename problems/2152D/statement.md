# Problem Description


For an array $$$b=[b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m]$$$ of length $$$m$$$ ($$$b_i \geq 2$$$), consider the following two-player game played by Poby and Rekkles.
The game ends once all elements in the array $$$b$$$ are equal to $$$1$$$.
Define thescoreof the game as the number of moves that Poby makes. Poby's goal is to minimize thescore, while Rekkles's goal is to maximize thescore.
Then, thevalueof the array $$$b$$$ is the score of the game when both players play optimally.
You are given an integer array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ ($$$a_i \ge 2$$$).
Answer $$$q$$$ independent queries. In each query, you are given a range $$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$ and must find thevalueof the array $$$[a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r]$$$.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 250\,000$$$) — the length of the array and the number of queries.
The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$2 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.
Then $$$q$$$ lines follow. The $$$j$$$-th of them contains two integers $$$l_j$$$ and $$$r_j$$$ ($$$1 \le l_j \le r_j \le n$$$) — the range of the subarray for the $$$i$$$-th query.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$250\,000$$$.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$250\,000$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output $$$q$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should contain a single integer representing the answer to the $$$i$$$-th query.
