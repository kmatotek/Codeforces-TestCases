# Problem Description

You are given $$$n$$$ sets $$$S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_n$$$, where each element in the sets is an integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$.
You want to choose some of the sets (possibly none or all), such that every integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$ is included inat least oneof the chosen sets.
You have to determine whether there existat least threeways to choose the sets.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 5\cdot 10^4$$$, $$$1\le m \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of sets and the upper bound of the integers in the sets.
Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th line first containing an integer $$$l_i$$$ ($$$1\le l_i\le m$$$) — the size of set $$$S_i$$$.
Then $$$l_i$$$ integers $$$S_{i,1}, S_{i,2}, \ldots, S_{i, l_i}$$$ follow in the same line ($$$1\le S_{i,1} < S_{i,2} < \cdots < S_{i, l_i}\le m$$$) — the elements of set $$$S_i$$$.
Let $$$L=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n l_i$$$. It is guaranteed that:

## Output
For each test case, print "YES" if there exist at least three ways to choose the sets. Otherwise, print "NO".
You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
