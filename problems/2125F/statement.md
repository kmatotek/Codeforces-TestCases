# Problem Description

Not so long ago, a certain Timofey learned about docker and now wants to present a report about it at a conference. He has already prepared the text $$$s$$$.
There are $$$n$$$ people attending the conference. The $$$i$$$-th attendee will understand Timofey's report if the number of occurrences of the word "docker" as a contiguous substring in the text is not less than $$$l_i$$$ and not greater than $$$r_i$$$.
To ensure that as many people as possible learn about docker, Timofey can change characters in his text.
Help Timofey determine the minimum number of characters that need to be changed so that the topic is understood by the maximum possible number of attendees.

## Input
Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^{4}$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 5 \cdot 10^{5}$$$) — Timofey's text, which consists of lowercase Latin letters.
The second line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^{5}$$$) — the number of attendees.
The next $$$n$$$ lines of each test case contain two integers $$$l_{i}, r_{i}$$$ ($$$1 \le l_{i} \le r_{i} \le 10^{9}$$$).
Additional constraints on the input data:

## Output
For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of characters that need to be changed so that the topic is understood by the maximum number of attendees.
