# Problem Description


There are $$$n$$$ monsters, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, in front of Gellyfish. The HP of the $$$i$$$-th monster is $$$h_i$$$.
Gellyfish doesn't want to kill them, but she wants to keep these monsters from being a threat to her. So she wants to reduce the HP of all the monsters to exactly $$$1$$$.
Now, Gellyfish, with The Sword Sharpened with Tears, is going to attack the monsters for $$$m$$$ rounds. For each round:
Please note that before Gellyfish decides whether or not to attack, she will know whether the sword shines or not. Also, when the sword shines, Gellyfish can only make attacks on all the monsters and cannot make an attack on only one monster.
Now, Gellyfish wants to know what the probability is that she will reach her goal if she makes choices optimally during the battle.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$p'$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 20$$$, $$$1 \leq m \leq 4000$$$, $$$0 \leq p' \leq 100$$$) — the number of monsters, the number of rounds of attacks, and an integer representing the probability $$$p = \frac {p'} {100}$$$ that the Sword Sharpened with Tears shines.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1,h_2,\ldots,h_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq h_i \leq 400$$$) — the HP of the monsters.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$100$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output a single real number representing the probability that Gellyfish will reach her goal.
Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.
Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\frac{|a - b|}{\max{(1, |b|)}} \le 10^{-6}$$$.
