# Problem Description

In order to test his patients' intelligence, Dr. TC created the following test.
First, he creates a binary string∗shavingncharacters. Then, he createsnbinary stringsa1,a2,…,an. It is known thataiis created by first copyings, then flipping thei'th character (1becomes0and vice versa). After creating allnstrings, he arranges them into a grid where thei'th row isai.
For example,
The patient needs to count the number of1s written on the board in less than a second. Can you pass the test?
∗A binary string is a string that only consists of characters1and0.

## Input
The first line of the input consists of a single integert(1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integern(1≤n≤10) — the length of the binary strings.
The second line of each test case contains a single binary stringsof sizen.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer, the number of1s on the board.
