# Problem Description


A circular array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$ isniceif every element has at least one adjacent element$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ that is equal to it. Formally, for every $$$1\le i\le m$$$, at least one of the following holds: $$$b_i = b_{(i+m-2)\bmod m\;+1}$$$, or $$$b_i = b_{i\bmod m\;+1}$$$, where $$$x \bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder from dividing $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$.
You are given a circular array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. In one operation, you may increase or decrease any element of $$$a$$$ by $$$1$$$. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make array $$$a$$$ nice. More formally, find the minimum value of $$$\sum_{i=1}^n |b_i - a_i|$$$ among all nice circular arrays $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$In a circular array of length $$$m$$$:

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the circular array $$$a$$$.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\le a_i\le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the circular array $$$a$$$.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum number of operations required to make array $$$a$$$ nice.
