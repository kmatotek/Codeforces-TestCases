# Problem Description

A polynomial $$$f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \ldots + a_nx^n$$$ is called a valid polynomial of degree $$$n$$$ if and only if $$$a_i$$$ is a non-negative integer for all $$$0 \le i \le n$$$ and $$$a_n$$$ is not $$$0$$$.
For a valid polynomial $$$f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \ldots + a_nx^n$$$ of degree $$$n$$$, itstwin polynomial$$$g(x)$$$ is defined as: $$$$$$ g(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n i \cdot x^{a_i} $$$$$$ For example, for $$$f(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^3$$$, itstwin polynomialis:
$$$$$$ g(x) = 0 \cdot x^{1} + 1 \cdot x^{2} + 2 \cdot x^{0} + 3 \cdot x^{2} = 0+x^2+2+3x^2= 2 + 4x^2 $$$$$$
A valid polynomial $$$f(x)$$$ of degree $$$n$$$ is calledcoolif and only if $$$f(x) = g(x)$$$. In other words, a valid polynomial of degree $$$n$$$ is cool if and only if its twin polynomial equals itself.
You are given an incomplete valid polynomial $$$f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \ldots + a_nx^n$$$ of degree $$$n$$$. Some of $$$a_i$$$ have been determined, while others have not been determined.Additionally, it is guaranteed that $$$a_0$$$ and $$$a_n$$$are not determined.
Please count the number ofcoolvalid polynomials of degree $$$n$$$ that can be found by determining all undetermined $$$a_i$$$'s. Since the answer may be large, you need to output it modulo $$$1\,000\,000\,007$$$.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
For each test case, the first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 4 \cdot 10^5$$$).
The second line contains $$$n+1$$$ integers $$$a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$). Here, $$$a_i=-1$$$ means $$$a_i$$$ has not been determined, while $$$a_i \neq -1$$$ means $$$a_i$$$ has been determined as its value.
It is guaranteed that $$$a_0$$$ and $$$a_n$$$ are always $$$-1$$$ in the input.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output the number ofcoolvalid polynomials of degree $$$n$$$ found by determining the undetermined $$$a_i$$$'s, modulo $$$1\,000\,000\,007$$$.
