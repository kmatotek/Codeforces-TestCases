# Problem Description

You are doing a research paper on the famous Collatz Conjecture. In your experiment, you start off with an integer $$$x$$$, and you do the following procedure $$$k$$$ times:
For example, starting off with $$$21$$$ and doing the procedure $$$5$$$ times, you get $$$21\rightarrow64\rightarrow32\rightarrow16\rightarrow8\rightarrow4$$$.
After all $$$k$$$ iterations, you are left with the final value of $$$x$$$. Unfortunately, you forgot the initial value. Please output any possible initial value of $$$x$$$.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 400$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \leq k,x \leq 20$$$).

## Output
For each test case, print any possible initial value on a new line. It can be shown that the answer always exists.
