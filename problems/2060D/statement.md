# Problem Description

You are given a sequenceaconsisting ofnpositive integers.
You can perform the following operation any number of times.
Determine if it is possible to make the sequencenon-decreasingby using the operation any number of times.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integern(2≤n≤2⋅105).
The second line of each test case containsa1,a2,…,an(1≤ai≤109).
It is guaranteed that the sum ofnover all test cases does not exceed2⋅105.

## Output
If it is possible to make the sequencenon-decreasing, print "YES" on a new line. Otherwise, print "NO" on a new line.
You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", and "Yes" will also be recognized as positive responses.
