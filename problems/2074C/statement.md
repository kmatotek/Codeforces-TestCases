# Problem Description

This time, the pink soldiers have given you an integerx(x≥2).
Please determine if there exists apositiveintegerythat satisfies the following conditions.
Additionally, if there exists such an integery, output any.
∗A triangle with side lengthsa,b,cis non-degenerate whena+b>c,a+c>b,b+c>a.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤2000). The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single integerx(2≤x≤109).

## Output
For each test case, print one integer on a separate line. The integer you must output is as follows:
If there exist multiple integers that satisfy the conditions, you may output any.
