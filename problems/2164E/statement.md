# Problem Description

You are on an undirected connected graph of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ weighted edges. The edges are indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. The $$$i$$$-th edge connects vertex $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$, and has weight $$$w_i$$$. You decided to take a wonderful journey around the graph.
Suppose you are at vertex $$$x$$$. You can do the following operations any number of times:
You are now at vertex $$$1$$$, and you need tomarkevery edge at least once and return to vertex $$$1$$$. Calculate the minimum cost.
Please note the cost fortransferringis not the maximum weight on the path, nor the maximum index itself. If you have any questions, refer to theNotesection below.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \le T \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^6$$$, $$$0 \le m \le 10^6$$$).
Then $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th line contains three integers $$$u_i, v_i, w_i$$$ ($$$1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$$$, $$$1 \le w \le 10^9$$$) — meaning that the edge with index $$$i$$$ is between vertex $$$u_i$$$ and vertex $$$v_i$$$ with weight $$$w_i$$$.
It's guaranteed that the described graph is connected.
Also note that the graph may haveself-loopsandmultiple edges.
It is guaranteed that the sums of $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ over all test cases do not exceed $$$10^6$$$ each.

## Output
For each test case output one integer — the minimum cost.
