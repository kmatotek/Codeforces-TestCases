# Problem Description


You are given a bracket string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You can apply the following operations arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) and in any order:
Find a regular bracket sequence$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$t$$$ which can be obtained from $$$s$$$ by applying the operations described above, or print $$$-1$$$ if there is no such $$$t$$$.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters"1"and"+"between the original characters of the sequence. For example: the bracket sequences"()()"and"(())"are regular (the resulting expressions are:"(1)+(1)"and"((1+1)+1)"); the bracket sequences")(","("and")"are not.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string.
The second line contains a single string $$$s$$$ — a sequence of the characters(and)of length $$$n$$$.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case output a regular bracket string $$$t$$$ which can be obtained from $$$s$$$ or print $$$-1$$$ if there is no such $$$t$$$.
