# Problem Description


You are given $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ within the range $$$[0,2^{30})$$$.
You can spend $$$1$$$ coin to increase any $$$a_i$$$ by $$$1$$$. You can perform this operation any number of times.
You need to solve $$$q$$$ queries; for each query, you are given an integer $$$c$$$, also in the range $$$[0,2^{30})$$$. You would like it if there exists a sequence $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ with the following properties:
Please calculate the minimum number of coins you will have to spend, such that there exists a suitable $$$b$$$.
The queries areindependent, meaning that any operations you perform on the sequence $$$a$$$ will not impact future queries.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case consists of two integers $$$n,q$$$ ($$$1\le n\le5\cdot10^5$$$, $$$1\le q\le5\cdot10^4$$$) — the length of sequence $$$a$$$ and the number of queries.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0\le a_i<2^{30}$$$) — the initial sequence $$$a$$$.
Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$c$$$ ($$$0\le c<2^{30}$$$) — the target XOR.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\cdot10^5$$$.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\cdot10^4$$$.

## Output
For each query, output a single integer — the minimum coins you will have to spend, such that there exists a suitable $$$b$$$.
