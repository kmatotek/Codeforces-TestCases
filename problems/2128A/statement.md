# Problem Description

In the recycling center, there are $$$n$$$ trash bags, the $$$i$$$-th bag has a weight of $$$a_i$$$. At each second, two actions will happen successively:

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 30$$$, $$$1 \leq c \leq 10^9)$$$.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the weight of each trash bag.

## Output
For each test case, you must output a single integer — the minimum number of coins you have to spend to destroy all trash bags.
