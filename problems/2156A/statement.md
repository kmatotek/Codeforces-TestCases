# Problem Description


Hao and Alex are good friends. After winning a coding competition together, they received a huge pizza as their prize.
Initially, they are given $$$n$$$ slices of pizza. Each day, the following process takes place:
$$$$$$m_1 + m_2 + m_3 = m\text{ and } 1 \le m_1\le m_2\le m_3.$$$$$$
Then:
Your task is to determine the maximum total number of slices Hao can eat if he always chooses the partition optimally.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 10^9$$$) — the initial number of pizza slices.
Note that there are no constraints on the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer representing the maximum total number of slices Hao can eat.
