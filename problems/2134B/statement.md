# Problem Description


You are given an array of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ and a positive integer $$$k$$$.
In one operation, you may add either $$$0$$$ or $$$k$$$ to each $$$a_i$$$, i.e., choose another array of $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ where each $$$b_i$$$ is either $$$0$$$ or $$$k$$$, and update $$$a_i$$$ to $$$a_i + b_i$$$ for $$$1 \le i \le n$$$. Note that you can choose different values for each element of the array $$$b$$$.
Your task is to perform at most $$$k$$$ such operations to make $$$\gcd(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) > 1$$$ $$$^{\text{∗}}$$$. It can be proved that this is always possible.
Output the final array after the operations. You donothave to output the operations themselves.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$$$$\gcd(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$$$ denotes thegreatest common divisor (GCD)of $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq k \leq 10^9$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the given constant.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output an array of $$$n$$$ integers in a new line — the final array after the operations. The integers in the output should be within the range from $$$1$$$ to $$$10^9 + k^2$$$.
If there are multiple valid outputs, you can output any of them.
Note that you donothave to minimize the number of operations.
