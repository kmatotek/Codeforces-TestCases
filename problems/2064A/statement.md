# Problem Description

One day after waking up, your friend challenged you to a brogramming contest. In a brogramming contest, you are given a binary string∗sof lengthnand an initially empty binary stringt. During a brogramming contest, you can make either of the following moves any number of times:
∗Abinary stringis a string consisting of characters0and1.
†A stringais a suffix of a stringbifacan be obtained from deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning ofb.

## Input
The first line contains an integert(1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is an integern(1≤n≤1000) — the length of the strings.
The second line of each test case contains the binary strings.
The sum ofnacross all test cases does not exceed1000.

## Output
For each testcase, output the minimum number of moves required.
