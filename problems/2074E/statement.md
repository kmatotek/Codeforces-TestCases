# Problem Description


This is an interactive problem.
The pink soldiers hid from youn(3≤n≤1500)fixedpoints(x1,y1),(x2,y2),…,(xn,yn),whose coordinates are not given to you. Also, it is known that no two points have the same coordinates, and no three points arecollinear.
You can ask the Frontman about threedistinctindicesi,j,k. Then, he will draw a triangle with points(xi,yi),(xj,yj),(xk,yk), and respond with the following:
Using at most75queries, you must find any triangle formed by three of the points,not containingany other hidden point inside.
Do note that the Frontman may beadaptivewhile choosing the point to give you. In other words, the choice of the point can be determined by various factors including but not limited to the orientation of points and the previous queries. However, note thatthe sequence of points will never be altered.
Hacks are disabled for this problem. Your solution will be judged on exactly35input files, including the example input.
