# Problem Description

You are given an integer $$$n$$$. Your task is to construct an array of length $$$2 \cdot n$$$ such that:
It can be shown that a solution always exists.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
Each of the next $$$t$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5}$$$).
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^{5}$$$.

## Output
For each test case, print a line containing $$$2 \cdot n$$$ integers — the array that satisfies the given conditions.
If there are multiple valid answers, print any of them.
