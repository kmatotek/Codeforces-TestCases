# Problem Description

You are given an integer $$$x$$$. You need to find the smallest non-negative integer $$$y$$$ such that the numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ share at least one common digit. In other words, there must exist a decimal digit $$$d$$$ that appears in both the representation of the number $$$x$$$ and the number $$$y$$$.

## Input
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le 1000$$$).

## Output
For each test case, output one integer $$$y$$$ — the minimum non-negative number that satisfies the condition.
