# Problem Description

A prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two divisors: $$$1$$$ and itself. The first several prime numbers are $$$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \dots$$$.
Prime factorization of a positive integer is representing it as a product of prime numbers. For example:
For every positive integer, its prime factorization is unique (if you don't consider the order of primes in the product).
We call a positive integergoodifallprimes in its factorization consist of at least two digits. For example:
You have to calculate the number of good integers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ (endpoints included).

## Input
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$2 \le l \le r \le 10^{18}$$$).

## Output
For each test case, print one integer — the number of good integers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$.
