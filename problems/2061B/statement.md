# Problem Description


Kevin hasnsticks with lengtha1,a2,…,an.
Kevin wants to select4sticks from these to form an isosceles trapezoid∗with a positive area. Note that rectangles and squares are also considered isosceles trapezoids. Help Kevin find a solution. If no solution exists, output−1.
∗Anisosceles trapezoidis a convex quadrilateral with a line of symmetry bisecting one pair of opposite sides. In any isosceles trapezoid, two opposite sides (the bases) are parallel, and the two other sides (the legs) are of equal length.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integern(4≤n≤2⋅105).
The second line containsnintegersa1,a2,…,an(1≤ai≤108).
It is guaranteed that the sum ofnover all test cases does not exceed2⋅105.

## Output
For each test case, output4integers — the lengths of sticks. If no solution exists, output−1.
If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
