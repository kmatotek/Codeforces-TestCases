# Problem Description

You are given a sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n-1$$$ and a sequence $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$.
You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
Your goal is to perform theminimum number of operationssuch that for every $$$1 \le i \le n-1$$$, the condition $$$b_i \, \& \, b_{i+1} = a_i$$$ holds, where $$$\&$$$ denotes thebitwise AND operation. If it is impossible to satisfy the condition, report it as well.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$).
The second line contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i < 2^{29}$$$).
The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \le b_i < 2^{29}$$$).
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, you need to output only one integer.
If the goal can be achieved, output one integer — the minimum number of operations required. Otherwise, output $$$-1$$$.
