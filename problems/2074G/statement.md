# Problem Description

There is a regular polygon withnsides (n≥3). The vertices are indexed as1,2,…,nin clockwise order. On each vertexi, the pink soldiers have written a positive integerai. With this regular polygon, you will play a game defined as follows.
Initially, your score is0. Then, you perform the following operation any number of times to increase your score.
Your objective is to maximize the score. Please find the maximum score you can get from this game.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integern— the number of vertices (3≤n≤400).
The second line of each test case containsa1,a2,…,an— the integers written on vertices (1≤ai≤1000).
It is guaranteed that the sum ofn3over all test cases does not exceed4003.

## Output
For each test case, output the maximum score you can get on a separate line.
