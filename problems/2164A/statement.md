# Problem Description

Given an integer sequence of length $$$n$$$ denoted as $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ and an integer $$$x$$$.
You can perform the following operation: select two adjacent numbers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$ and replace them with an integer $$$y$$$, which satisfies $$$\min(a_i,a_{i+1}) \le y \le \max(a_i,a_{i+1})$$$. After the replacement, the original $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_{i+1}$$$ are removed from the sequence, and the elements are renumbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$.
For example, for $$$a=[1,2,4,5]$$$ you can select $$$a_2=2$$$ and $$$a_3=4$$$, and replace them with $$$3$$$. After that, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[1,3,5]$$$. However, you cannot select $$$a_1=1$$$ and $$$a_2=2$$$ and replace them with $$$3$$$ (since $$$y$$$ is bigger than $$$\max(a_i,a_{i+1})$$$, nor can you select $$$a_1=1$$$ and $$$a_3=4$$$ (the selected numbers should be adjacent).
Clearly, after performing $$$n-1$$$ operations, only one number will remain. The question is whether this final number can be exactly equal to $$$x$$$.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \le T \le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$).
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).
The third line of each test case contains one integer $$$x$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le x \le 10^9$$$).

## Output
For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if the final number can be exactly equal to $$$x$$$, and "NO" otherwise.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yES", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).
