# Problem Description


For all positive integers $$$x\ge 1$$$ and $$$k\ge 2$$$, let $$$v_k(x!)$$$ denote the number of trailing zeros in the base-$$$k$$$ representation of $$$x! = x\cdot (x-1)\cdot \ldots \cdot 1$$$. Formally, $$$v_k(x!)$$$ is defined as the largest integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$k^i$$$ divides $$$x!$$$.
For a prime number $$$p$$$, we can calculate $$$v_p(x!) = \sum\limits_{j=1}^\infty \left\lfloor \frac{x}{p^j}\right\rfloor$$$$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$. If $$$k$$$ is not prime, write its prime factorization as $$$k = \prod p_i^{e_i}$$$, where $$$p_i$$$ are distinct prime factors and $$$e_i$$$ are their corresponding exponents. Then, $$$$$$v_k(x!) = \min\limits_i \left\lfloor \frac{v_{p_i}(x!)}{e_i}\right\rfloor.$$$$$$
For any two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, and any integer $$$k\ge 2$$$, the weight of the pair $$$(a, b)$$$ with respect to $$$k$$$, denoted by $$$w_k(a, b)$$$, is defined as $$$$$$w_k(a, b) = \begin{cases}\min(v_k(a!), v_k(b!)) & \text{if }v_k(a!)\neq v_k(b!)\text{;}\\10^{100} & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$$$$$$
Next, define $$$f_m(a, b)$$$ as the minimum weight of the pair $$$(a, b)$$$ with respect to $$$k$$$, taken over all integers $$$k$$$ with $$$2\le k\le m$$$: $$$$$$f_m(a, b)=\min\limits_{2\le k\le m}w_k(a, b).$$$$$$
You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$. Your task is to compute the sum of $$$f_m(x, n)$$$ over all positive integers $$$x$$$ less than $$$n$$$: $$$$$$\sum_{1\le x\le n - 1} f_m(x, n).$$$$$$
It can be shown that under the given constraints, the result is strictly less than $$$10^{100}$$$.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$$$$\lfloor y\rfloor$$$ denotes thefloorof $$$y$$$, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to $$$y$$$.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2\le n\le m\le 10^7$$$) — the parameters of the function.
Note that there are no constraints on the sum of $$$n, m$$$ over all test cases.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer representing $$$\sum\limits_{1\le x\le n - 1} f_m(x, n)$$$.
