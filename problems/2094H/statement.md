# Problem Description

Saturnita's mood depends on an arrayaof lengthn, which only he knows the meaning of, and a functionf(k,a,l,r), which only he knows how to compute. Shown below is the pseudocode for his functionf(k,a,l,r).
You are givenqqueries, each containing integersk,l, andr. For each query, please outputf(k,a,l,r).

## Input
The first line contains an integert(1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integersnandq(1≤n≤105,1≤q≤5⋅104).
The following line containsnintegersa1,a2,…,an(2≤ai≤105).
The followingqlines each contain three integersk,l, andr(1≤k≤105,1≤l≤r≤n).
It is guaranteed that the sum ofndoes not exceed105over all test cases, and the sum ofqdoes not exceed5⋅104over all test cases.

## Output
For each query, output the answer on a new line.
