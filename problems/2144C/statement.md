# Problem Description

You are given two integer arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ both of length $$$n$$$.
You can choose any subset of indices and swap the elements at those positions (i. e. make a swap($$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$) for each $$$i$$$ in the subset). A subset of indices is consideredgoodif, after the swapping, both arrays are sorted in non-descending order.
Your task is to calculate the number of good subsets. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.

## Input
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$).
The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 1000$$$).
The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 1000$$$).
Additional constraint on the input: there is at least one good subset.

## Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the number of good subsets, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.
