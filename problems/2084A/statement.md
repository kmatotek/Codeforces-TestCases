# Problem Description


You are given an integer $$$n$$$. Find any permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ such that:
If it is impossible to find such a permutation $$$p$$$, output $$$-1$$$.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).
$$$^{\text{†}}$$$$$$x \bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder from dividing $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 99$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 100$$$).

## Output
For each test case:
