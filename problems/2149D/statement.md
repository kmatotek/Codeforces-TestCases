# Problem Description

Given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of the characters 'a' and 'b'.
In one operation, you can choose a position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n-1$$$) and swap the neighboring characters $$$s_i$$$ and $$$s_{i+1}$$$.
You need to perform the minimum number of operations to ensure that all characters of one type (either $$$a$$$ or $$$b$$$) are located strictly together, forming exactly one continuous block.
Characters of the other type can be positioned either before or after this block, forming two (possibly empty) blocks.
Examples of valid final forms:
You need to find the minimum number of described operations required to achieve the specified state.

## Input
Each test consists of several test cases.
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$.
The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of the characters 'a' and 'b'.
It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of operations required for all characters of one of the two types to form a single continuous block.
