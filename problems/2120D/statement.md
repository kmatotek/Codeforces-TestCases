# Problem Description

Aryan and Harshith play a game. They both start with three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$k$$$. Aryan then gives Harshith two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$. Harshith then gives Aryan a matrix $$$X$$$ with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns, such that each of the elements of $$$X$$$ is between $$$1$$$ and $$$k$$$(inclusive). After that, Aryan wins if he can find a submatrix$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$Y$$$ of $$$X$$$ with $$$a$$$ rows and $$$b$$$ columns such that all elements of $$$Y$$$ are equal.
For example, when $$$a=2, b=2, k=6, n=3$$$ and $$$m=3$$$, if Harshith gives Aryan the matrix below, it is a win for Aryan as it has a submatrix of size $$$2\times 2$$$ with all elements equal to $$$1$$$ as shown below.
Aryan gives you the values of $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$k$$$. He asks you to find the lexicographically minimum tuple $$$(n,m)$$$ that he should give to Harshith such that Aryan always wins. Help Aryan win the game. Assume that Harshith plays optimally. The values of $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ can be large, so output them modulo $$$10^9+7$$$. A tuple $$$(n_1, m_1)$$$ is said to be lexicographically smaller than $$$(n_2, m_2)$$$ if either $$$n_1<n_2$$$ or $$$n_1=n_2$$$ and $$$m_1<m_2$$$.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A submatrix of a matrix is obtained by removing some rows and/or columns from the original matrix.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
Each test case contains a single line with three space-separated integers $$$a, b$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1\leq a,b,k\leq 10^5$$$).
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$\max(a, b, k)$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output a single line containing two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, denoting the answer to the problem. The values of $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ can be large, so output them modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.
