# Problem Description

Given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, determine the lexicographically largest$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ subsequence$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ $$$s$$$ of $$$a$$$ such that $$$s$$$ can be the side lengths of a polygon.
Recall that $$$s$$$ can be the side lengths of a polygon if and only if $$$|s| \geq 3$$$ and
$$$$$$ 2 \cdot \max(s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_{|s|}) < s_1 + s_2 + \ldots + s_{|s|}. $$$$$$
If no such subsequence $$$s$$$ exists, print $$$-1$$$.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A sequence $$$x$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a sequence $$$y$$$ if and only if one of the following holds:
$$$^{\text{†}}$$$A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deleting several (possibly zero or all) elements.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.
The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.
It is guaranteed that the total sum of all values of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output the answer in the following format:
If the answer exists, output the following.
In the first line, output the integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq n$$$) — the length of the subsequence $$$s$$$.
In the second line, output $$$k$$$ integers $$$s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k$$$ ($$$1 \leq s_i \leq 10^9$$$, $$$s$$$ is a subsequence of $$$a$$$) — the subsequence $$$s$$$. Note that the desired output is the value, not the index.
Otherwise, output a single line with the integer $$$-1$$$.
