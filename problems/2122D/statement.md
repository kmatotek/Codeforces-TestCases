# Problem Description


You are given a simple undirected connected graph of $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges.
There is a token in vertex $$$1$$$. We consider the initial time to be at $$$0$$$ seconds. After $$$t$$$ seconds, if the token is in vertex $$$u$$$, you must do exactly one of the following:
The order of edges of a vertex is the order that they appear in the input.
Calculate the minimum time required to move the token from vertex $$$1$$$ to vertex $$$n$$$, and the minimum time spent waiting that can be achieved while minimizing the total time.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$$$$x \bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder from dividing $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 5000$$$, $$$n - 1 \leq m \leq \frac{n(n - 1)}{2}$$$) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively.
Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th line containing two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n$$$) — the vertices of the $$$i$$$-th edge.
It is guaranteed that the graph is connected and simple.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$, and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output a single line containing two integers — the minimum total time and the minimum waiting time that minimizes the total time, respectively.
