# Problem Description


You are given a binary sequencesof lengthnwhich only consists of0and1.
You can do the following operationat mostn−2times(possibly zero):
Note that after every operation, the length ofsdecreases by1.
Find how many different binary sequences can be obtained after performing the operation, modulo109+7.
∗The median of an array of odd lengthkis thek+12-th element when sorted.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integern(3≤n≤2⋅106) — the length of the binary sequence.
The second line of each test case contains a stringsof lengthn, consisting of only0and1.
It is guaranteed that the sum ofnover all test cases does not exceed2⋅106.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of binary sequences that can be obtained, modulo109+7.
