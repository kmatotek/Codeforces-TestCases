# Problem Description

Monsters are approaching the city, and to protect it, Akito must create a protective field around the city. As everyone knows, protective fields come in various levels. Akito has chosen the field of leveln. To construct the field, a special phrase is required, which is then-th row of the Great Magical Triangle, represented as a two-dimensional array. We will call this arrayT.
The triangle is defined as follows:
Help Akito find the integers in then-th row of the infinite triangle before the monsters reach the city.

## Input
The first line contains the integert(1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
In the only line of each test case, there are two integersnandk(1≤n≤106,1≤k<231) — the row index that Akito needs and the integer in the first row of the Great Magical Triangle, respectively.
It is guaranteed that the sum ofnacross all test cases does not exceed106.

## Output
For each test case, outputnintegers — the elements of then-th row of the Great Magical Triangle.
