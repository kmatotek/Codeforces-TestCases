# Problem Description

Alice and Bob are playing a game in which Alice has given Bob a positive integer $$$x<10^8$$$.
To win the game, Bob has to find another positive integer $$$y<10^9$$$ such that $$$x \operatorname{\#} y$$$ is divisible by $$$x + y$$$.
Here $$$x\operatorname{\#}y$$$ denotes the integer formed byconcatenatingthe integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ in that order. For example, if $$$x = 835$$$, $$$y = 47$$$, then $$$x \operatorname{\#} y = 83\,547$$$.
However, since Bob is dumb, he is unable to find such an integer. Please help him.
It can be shown that such an integer always exists.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x < 10^8$$$) — the integer that Alice has given to Bob.

## Output
For each test case, print a single integer $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \le y < 10^9$$$) so that Bob can win the game.
If there are multiple answers, print any one of them.
