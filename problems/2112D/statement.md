# Problem Description

Let $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ be two distinct vertices in a directed graph. Let's call the ordered pair $$$(u, v)$$$goodif there exists a path from vertex $$$u$$$ to vertex $$$v$$$ along the edges of the graph.
You are given an undirected tree with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$n - 1$$$ edges. Determine whether it is possible to assign a direction to each edge of this tree so that the number of good pairs in it isexactly$$$n$$$. If it is possible, print any way to direct the edges resulting in exactly $$$n$$$ good pairs.

## Input
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.
The next $$$n - 1$$$ lines describe the edges. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$$$; $$$u_i \neq v_i$$$) — the vertices connected by the $$$i$$$-th edge.
It is guaranteed that the edges in each test case form an undirected tree and that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, print "NO" (case-insensitive) if it is impossible to direct all edges of the tree and obtain exactly $$$n$$$ good pairs of vertices.
Otherwise, print "YES" (case-insensitive) and then print $$$n - 1$$$ pairs of integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ separated by spaces — the edges directed from $$$u_i$$$ to $$$v_i$$$.
The edges can be printed in any order. If there are multiple answers, output any.
