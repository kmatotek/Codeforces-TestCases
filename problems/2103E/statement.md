# Problem Description


You are given an integer $$$k$$$ and an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, where each element satisfies $$$0 \le a_i \le k$$$ for all $$$1 \le i \le n$$$. You can perform the following operation on the array:
Note that the constraints on $$$x$$$ ensure that all elements of array $$$a$$$ remain between $$$0$$$ and $$$k$$$ throughout the operations.
Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make the array $$$a$$$ non-decreasing$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ using the above operation. If it is possible, find a sequence of at most $$$3n$$$ operations that transforms the array into a non-decreasing one.
It can be proven that if it is possible to make the array non-decreasing using the above operation, there exists a solution that uses at most $$$3n$$$ operations.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ An array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ is said to be non-decreasing if for all $$$1 \le i \le n - 1$$$, it holds that $$$a_i \le a_{i+1}$$$.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers, $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$4 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 10^9$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the required sum for the operation.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le k$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output $$$-1$$$ if it is not possible to make the array non-decreasing using the operation.
Otherwise, output the number of operations $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \le m \le 3n$$$). On each of the next $$$m$$$ lines, output three integers $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, and $$$x$$$ representing an operation where $$$a_i$$$ is decreased by $$$x$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ is increased by $$$x$$$.
Note that you arenotrequired to minimize the number of operations. If there are multiple solutions requiring at most $$$3n$$$ operations, you may output any.
