# Problem Description

Trulicina gives you integersn,m, andk. It is guaranteed thatk≥2andn⋅m≡0(modk).
Output anbymgrid of integers such that each of the following criteria hold:
It can be shown that such a grid always exists. If there are multiple solutions, output any.

## Input
The first line contains an integert(1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains three integersn,m, andk(2≤n⋅m≤2⋅105,2≤k≤n⋅m,n⋅m≡0(modk)).
It is guaranteed that the sum ofn⋅mover all test cases does not exceed2⋅105.

## Output
For each test case, outputnlines, each containingmintegers that satisfy the criteria. If there are multiple solutions, output any.
