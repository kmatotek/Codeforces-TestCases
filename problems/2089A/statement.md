# Problem Description

Given an integern. Construct a permutationp1,p2,…,pnof lengthnthat satisfies the following property:
For1≤i≤n, defineci=⌈p1+p2+…+pii⌉, then amongc1,c2,…,cnthere must be at least⌊n3⌋−1prime numbers.

## Input
The first line contains an integert(1≤t≤10) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
In a single line of each test case, there is a single integern(2≤n≤105)— the size of the permutation.

## Output
For each test case, output the permutationp1,p2,…,pnof lengthnthat satisfies the condition. It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists.
