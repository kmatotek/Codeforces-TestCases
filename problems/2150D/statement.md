# Problem Description

There are $$$n$$$ people in positions $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ on a one-dimensional coordinate axis. Initially, $$$p_i = i$$$ for each $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$.
You can introduce an attraction at someintegercoordinate $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le n$$$), and then all the people will move closer to the attraction to look at it.
Formally, if you put an attraction in position $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le n$$$), the following changes happen for each person $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$):
You can put attractions any finite number of times, and in any order you want.
It can be proven that all positions of a person always stays within the range $$$[1, n]$$$, i.e. $$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$ at all times.
Each position $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le n$$$), has a value $$$a_x$$$ associated with it. The score of a position array $$$[p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n]$$$, denoted by $$$score(p)$$$, is $$$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_{p_i}$$$, i.e. your score increases by $$$a_x$$$ for every person standing at $$$x$$$ in the end.
Over all possible distinct position arrays $$$p$$$ that are possible with placing attractions, find the sum of $$$score(p)$$$. Since the answer may be large, print it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers — $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$)
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the sum of $$$score(p)$$$ over all possible distinct position arrays $$$p$$$ that are possible with placing attractions, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.
