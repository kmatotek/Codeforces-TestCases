# Problem Description

Let's call a letterallowedif it is a lowercase letter and is one of the first $$$k$$$ letters of the Latin alphabet.
You are given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of allowed letters.
Let's call a string $$$t$$$pleasantif $$$t$$$ is a subsequence of $$$s$$$.
You are given $$$q$$$ strings $$$t_1, t_2, \dots, t_q$$$. All of them consist only of allowed letters. For each string $$$t_i$$$, calculate the minimum number of allowed letters you need to append to it on the right so that itstopsbeing pleasant.
A sequence $$$t$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$s$$$ if $$$t$$$ can be obtained from $$$s$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.

## Input
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^6$$$; $$$1 \le k \le 26$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$ and the number of allowed letters.
The second line contains the string $$$s$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin letters. Each character of the string is one of the first $$$k$$$ letters of the Latin alphabet.
The third line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.
The next $$$q$$$ lines contain queries: one query per line. The $$$i$$$-th line contains the string $$$t_i$$$, consisting only of allowed letters.
Additional constraint on input: the total length of all $$$t_i$$$ does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

## Output
For each query, output one integer — the minimum number of allowed letters that need to be appended to the string on the right so that it stops being pleasant.
