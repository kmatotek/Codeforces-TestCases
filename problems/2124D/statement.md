# Problem Description

You are given an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$, and an integer $$$k$$$. You may perform the following operation any number of times:
Determine if it is possible to get an array that is a palindrome$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ after any number of operations. Note that an empty array is considered a palindrome.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$An array $$$b=[b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m]$$$ is a palindrome if for each $$$1 \leq i \leq m$$$, $$$b_i=b_{m+1-i}$$$.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$).
The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$) — denoting the array $$$a$$$.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, outputYESif it is possible to create a palindrome, andNOotherwise. You can output in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings"yEs","yes","Yes", and"YES"will be recognized as positive responses.
