# Problem Description

For each integer $$$x$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, we will form the string $$$S(x)$$$ according to the following rules:
For example, the string $$$S(139)$$$ is011349(before sorting the digits, it is139140). The string $$$S(99)$$$ is00199.
Your task is to count the number of distinct strings among $$$S(1), S(2), \dots, S(n)$$$.

## Input
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^{9} - 2$$$).

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of distinct strings among $$$S(1), S(2), \dots, S(n)$$$.
