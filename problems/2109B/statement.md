# Problem Description

Duelists Mouf and Fouad enter the arena, which is ann×mgrid!
Fouad's monster starts at cell(a,b), where rows are numbered1tonand columns1tom.
Mouf and Fouad will keep duelling until the grid consists of only one cell.
In each turn:
Mouf wants to minimize the number of turns, while Fouad wants to maximize them. How many turns will this epic duel last if both play optimally?

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four integersn,m,a, andb(2≤n,m≤109,1≤a≤n,1≤b≤m) — denoting the number of rows, the number of columns, the starting row of the monster, and the starting column of the monster, respectively.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of turns this epic duel will last if both play optimally.
