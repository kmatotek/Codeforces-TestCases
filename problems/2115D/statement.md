# Problem Description


Gellyfish and Flower are playing a game.
The game consists of two arrays of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ and $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$$$, along with a binary string $$$c_1c_2\ldots c_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$.
There is also an integer $$$x$$$ which is initialized to $$$0$$$.
The game consists of $$$n$$$ rounds. For $$$i = 1,2,\ldots,n$$$, the round proceeds as follows:
Here, $$$\oplus$$$ denotes thebitwise XOR operation.
Gellyfish wants to minimize the final value of $$$ x $$$ after $$$ n $$$ rounds, while Flower wants to maximize it.
Find the final value of $$$ x $$$ after all $$$ n $$$ rounds if both players play optimally.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of rounds of the game.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_i < 2^{60}$$$).
The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq b_i < 2^{60}$$$).
The fourth line of each test case contains a binary string $$$c$$$ of length $$$n$$$.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the final value of $$$ x $$$ after all $$$ n $$$ rounds.
