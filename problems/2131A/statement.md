# Problem Description

In Divergent Universe, The Lever iterates itself given two arraysaandbof lengthn. In each iteration, The Lever will do the following:
After each iteration, the Lever will check if step1is ignored, and if so, it will end its iteration.
You're given the two arrays. Find the number of iterations that the Lever does. It can be shown this number is fixed over all possibilities of random indices that The Lever can choose for each step.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integern(1≤n≤10).
The second line of each test case containsnintegersa1,a2,…,an(1≤ai≤10).
The third line of each test case containsnintegersb1,b2,…,bn(1≤bi≤10).

## Output
For each test case, output one integer — the number of iterations that the Lever does.
