# Problem Description

To train young Kevin's arithmetic skills, his mother devised the following problem.
Givennintegersa1,a2,…,anand a sumsinitialized to0, Kevin performs the following operation fori=1,2,…,nin order:
Note that Kevin can earn at most one point per operation, regardless of how many divisions he does.
Since these divisions are considered more beneficial for Kevin's development, his mother wants to rearrangeaso that the number of Kevin's total points is maximized. Determine the maximum number of points.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤500). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integern(1≤n≤100) — the number of integers.
The second line containsnintegersa1,a2,…,an(1≤ai≤109).

## Output
For each test case, output one integer — the maximum number of points.
