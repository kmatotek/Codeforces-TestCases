# Problem Description

You are given an array $$$a$$$ ofdistinctintegers.
In one operation, you may either:
Note that you may choose the entire array $$$a$$$.
For each element $$$a_i$$$, determine if there exists some sequence of operations to transform $$$a$$$ into $$$[a_i]$$$; that is, make the array $$$a$$$ consist of only one element, which is $$$a_i$$$. Output your answer as a binary string of length $$$n$$$, where the $$$i$$$-th character is $$$1$$$ if there exists a sequence to transform $$$a$$$ into $$$[a_i]$$$, and $$$0$$$ otherwise.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$Aprefixof an array is a subarray consisting of the first $$$k$$$ elements of the array, for some integer $$$k$$$.
$$$^{\text{†}}$$$Asuffixof an array is a subarray consisting of the last $$$k$$$ elements of the array, for some integer $$$k$$$.

## Input
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers, $$$a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6$$$). It is guaranteed that all $$$a_i$$$ are distinct.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output a binary string of length $$$n$$$  — the $$$i$$$-th character should be $$$1$$$ if there exists a sequence of operations as described above, and $$$0$$$ otherwise.
