# Problem Description


As a child, Steve yearned for the mines! His mine can be represented as a tree$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$n$$$ nodes.
Unfortunately, Steve's mine has been infiltrated by his greatest nemesis, Herobrine! At any time, Herobrine is hiding in exactly one node; initially, he may be in any of them. Steve can perform the following operations:
Find a sequence of at most $$$\left\lfloor \frac{5}{4} \cdot n \right\rfloor$$$ operations that will guarantee Steve catches Herobrine, regardless of Herobrine's initial location and moves. We have a proof that, under the given constraints, this is always possible.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A tree is a connected graph without cycles.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of nodes.
Each of the next $$$n − 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u, v \le n$$$), describing an edge between nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.
It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, first output a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le \left\lfloor \frac{5}{4} \cdot n \right\rfloor$$$) — the number of operations you wish to perform.
Then output $$$k$$$ lines. Line $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le k$$$) should contain two integers $$$t_i$$$ and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \le t_i \le 2$$$, $$$1 \le x_i \le n$$$), indicating that the $$$i$$$-th operation you wish to perform is operation $$$t_i$$$ on node $$$x_i$$$.
