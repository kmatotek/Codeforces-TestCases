# Problem Description

For her birthday, each of Asuna'sn𝑛admirers gifted her a tower. The height of the tower from thei𝑖-th admirer is equal toai𝑎𝑖.
Asuna evaluates the beauty of the received gifts asmax(a1,a2,…,an)max(𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛). She can perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).
Help Asuna find the maximum possible beauty of the gifts after any number of operations!

## Input
Each test consists of several test cases. The first line of the input data contains one integert𝑡(1≤t≤1041≤𝑡≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integern𝑛(1≤n≤2⋅1051≤𝑛≤2⋅105) — the number of admirers of Asuna.
The second line of each test case containsn𝑛integersa1,a2,…,an(1≤ai≤109)𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛(1≤𝑎𝑖≤109)— the heights of the towers.
It is guaranteed that the sum ofn𝑛across all test cases does not exceed2⋅1052⋅105.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum value of the beauty of the gifts that Asuna can achieve.
