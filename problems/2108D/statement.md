# Problem Description

This is an interactive problem.
You found the numberskandnin the attic, but lost two arraysAandB.
You remember that:
Fortunately, a kind spirit that settled in the attic found these arrays and concatenated them into an arrayCof lengthn. That is, the elements of arrayAwere first written into arrayC, followed by the elements of arrayB.
You can ask the kind spirit up to250questions. Each question contains an indexi(1≤i≤n). In response, you will receive thei-th element of the concatenated arrayC.
You need to find the lengths of arraysAandB, or report that it is impossible to determine them uniquely.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤300). The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integersnandk(1≤k≤50,2k≤n≤106).
Note that the sum ofnacross test cases isnot limited.
