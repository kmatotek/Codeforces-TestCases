# Problem Description

You are given a binary string∗sof lengthnand you are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):
For the binary string110110, if we choosei=1,j=2,k=3and perform a right shift cyclically, the string becomes011110; if we choosei=4,j=5,k=6and perform a left shift cyclically, the string becomes110101.
Determine the minimum number of operations required to sort the given binary string.
∗Abinary stringis a string that consists only of the characters0and1.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤100). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integern(3≤n≤100) — the length of the string.
The second line contains a binary stringsof lengthn.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations required to sort the given binary string.
