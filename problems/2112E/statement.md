# Problem Description

Consider a rooted undirected tree. Each vertex can be colored blue, green, or yellow. A coloring is calledbeautifulif it meets these conditions:
You are given an integer $$$m$$$. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of vertices in a tree withexactly$$$m$$$beautifulcolorings.

## Input
The first line contains a single integer ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le m \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$).

## Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of vertices in a tree withexactly$$$m$$$beautifulcolorings. If such a tree does not exist, print $$$-1$$$.
