# Problem Description

You are given a tree$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ with $$$n$$$ nodes and values $$$l_i, r_i$$$ for each node. You can choose an initial value $$$a_i$$$ satisfying $$$l_i\le a_i\le r_i$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th node. A tree isbalancedif all node values are equal, and the value of a balanced tree is defined as the value of any node.
In one operation, you can choose two nodes $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$, and increase the values of all nodes in the subtree$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of node $$$v$$$ by $$$1$$$ while considering $$$u$$$ as the root of the entire tree. Note that $$$u$$$ may be equal to $$$v$$$.
Your goal is to perform a series of operations so that the tree becomesbalanced. Find the minimum possible value of the tree after performing these operations. Note that youdon'tneed to minimize the number of operations.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A tree is a connected graph without cycles.
$$$^{\text{†}}$$$Node $$$w$$$ is considered in the subtree of node $$$v$$$ if any path from root $$$u$$$ to $$$w$$$ must go through $$$v$$$.

## Input
The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of input test cases.
The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of nodes in the tree.
Then $$$n$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$l_i,r_i$$$ ($$$0\le l_i \le r_i\le 10^9$$$) — the constraint of the value of the $$$i$$$-th node.
The next $$$n-1$$$ lines contain the edges of the tree. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i,v_i$$$ ($$$1\le u_i,v_i \le n$$$, $$$u_i \neq v_i$$$) — an edge connecting $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible value that all $$$a_i$$$ can be made equal to after performing the operations. It can be shown that the answer always exists.
