# Problem Description

The pink soldiers drewncircles with their centeron thex-axisof the plane. Also, they have told thatthe sum of radii is exactlym∗.
Please find the number of integer pointsinside or on the border ofat least one circle. Formally, the problem is defined as follows.
You are given an integer sequencex1,x2,…,xnand a positive integer sequencer1,r2,…,rn, where it is known that∑ni=1ri=m.
You must count the number of integer pairs(x,y)that satisfy the following condition.
∗Is this information really useful? Don't ask me; I don't really know.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test casest(1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integersnandm(1≤n≤m≤2⋅105).
The second line of each test case containsx1,x2,…,xn— the centers of the circles (−109≤xi≤109).
The third line of each test case containsr1,r2,…,rn— the radii of the circles (1≤ri,∑ni=1ri=m).
It is guaranteed thatthe sum ofmover all test casesdoes not exceed2⋅105.

## Output
For each test case, output the number of integer points satisfying the condition on a separate line.
