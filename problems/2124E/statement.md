# Problem Description

You are given an array $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers. You are allowed to do the following operation:
Your task is to change all the elements to $$$0$$$. Find theminimumnumber of operations required.
Then, output a way to perform the operations. If it is impossible to change all the elements of $$$a$$$ to $$$0$$$ no matter how many operations are used, print $$$-1$$$ instead. It can be shown that under the constraints of this problem, the smallest number of operations required is at most $$$17$$$.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 5\cdot 10^4$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^{12}$$$) — denoting the array $$$a$$$.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\cdot 10^4$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output $$$-1$$$ if there is no solution.
Otherwise, first output an integer $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \leq s \leq 17$$$) – the minimum number of operations to change all the elements of $$$a$$$ to $$$0$$$.
Then, in the next $$$s$$$ lines, output $$$n$$$ integers in each line $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n (0 \leq b_i \leq a_i)$$$ — denoting the array $$$b$$$ for each operation.
After performing the operations, all the elements of $$$a$$$ should be changed to $$$0$$$.
