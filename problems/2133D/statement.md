# Problem Description


Steve made the foolish decision to mine at night, and came across a monstrous creature: thechicken jockey$$$^n$$$!
A chicken jockey$$$^n$$$ consists of $$$n$$$ mobs stacked in order on top of each other, with mob $$$1$$$ at the bottom and mob $$$n$$$ at the top. Mob $$$i$$$ initially has $$$h_i$$$ health.
In one attack, Steve can deal $$$1$$$ damage to any mob. If any mob reaches $$$0$$$ or less health, it dies, and all the mobs on top of it fall down and form anewstack. Thebottommob in the new stack takes $$$1$$$ fall damage for every mob it was on top of before falling (i.e. the number of mobs below it in the previous stack, including the one that just died). This may kill it as well, in which case all mobs on top of it fall down again and the process repeats.
For example, consider a chicken jockey$$$^6$$$ with initial mob healths $$$[1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 2]$$$. If Steve damages the third mob in the stack, it dies and the mobs with health $$$[3, 5, 2]$$$ fall down in a new stack. The bottom mob takes $$$3$$$ units of fall damage so it also dies, and the mobs with health $$$[5, 2]$$$ fall down in a new stack. The bottom mob takes $$$1$$$ unit of fall damage. As a result, after Steve's first attack, there will be two stacks with healths $$$[1, 2]$$$ and $$$[4, 2]$$$.
Steve's sword's durability is low, so he wishes to know the minimum attacks required to kill all the mobs.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of mobs.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$h_1, h_2,\ldots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \le h_i \le 10^9$$$) — the initial health of each mob.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum attacks required to kill all the mobs.
