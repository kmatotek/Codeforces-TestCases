# Problem Description

You are given an arraya1,a2,…,an, consisting ofnintegers.
In one operation, you are allowed to perform one of the following actions:
Note that the elements affected by an operation may already be equal toai, but that doesn't change the cost.
You are allowed to perform any number of operations (including zero). What is the minimum total cost to make all elements of the array equal?

## Input
The first line contains one integert(1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integern(2≤n≤5⋅105).
The second line containsnintegersa1,a2,…,an(1≤ai≤n).
The sum ofnover all test cases does not exceed5⋅105.

## Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum total cost of operations to make all elements of the array equal.
