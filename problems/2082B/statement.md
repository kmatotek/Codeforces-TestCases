# Problem Description

Ecrade has an integer $$$x$$$. There are two kinds of operations.
Ecrade will perform exactly $$$n$$$ first operations and $$$m$$$ second operations in any order. He wants to know the minimum and the maximum possible value of $$$x$$$ after $$$n+m$$$ operations. However, it seems a little difficult, so please help him!

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains three integers $$$x$$$, $$$n$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \le x, n, m \le 10^9$$$).

## Output
For each test case, print two integers in one line, representing the minimum and the maximum possible value of $$$x$$$ after $$$n + m$$$ operations.
