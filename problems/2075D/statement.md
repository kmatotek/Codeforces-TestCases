# Problem Description

You are given two non-negative integersxandy.
You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): choose a positive integerkand divide eitherxoryby2krounding down. The cost of this operation is2k. However, there is an additional constraint: you cannot select the same value ofkmore than once.
Your task is to calculate the minimum possible cost in order to makexequal toy.

## Input
The first line contains a single integert(1≤t≤105) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains two integersxandy(0≤x,y≤1017).

## Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum possible cost in order to makexequal toy.
