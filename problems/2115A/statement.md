# Problem Description

Gellyfish hates math problems, but she has to finish her math homework:
Gellyfish is given an array of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$.
She needs to do the following two-step operation until all elements of $$$a$$$ are equal:
Now, Gellyfish asks you for the minimum number of operations to achieve her goal.
It can be proven that Gellyfish can always achieve her goal.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5000$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 5000$$$) — the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 5000$$$) — the elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations to achieve her goal.
