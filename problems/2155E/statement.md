# Problem Description


Mimo and Yuyu just finished their 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle of beautiful Bellas Artes! Now they are looking for other ways to entertain themselves.
There is an $$$n \times m$$$ grid of cells with columns labeled $$$1, 2, \ldots m$$$ from left to right and rows labeled $$$1, 2, \ldots n$$$ from top to bottom. Let $$$(u, v)$$$ ($$$1 \le u \le n, 1 \le v \le m$$$) denote the cell in the $$$u$$$-th row and $$$v$$$-th column. Each cell can contain any number of tokens which are indistinguishable among themselves. Initially, there are $$$k$$$ tokens, the $$$i$$$-th of which is located in $$$(x_i, y_i)$$$.
Mimo and Yuyu now play a game alternating turns. On his/her turn, a player chooses a token $$$c$$$ currently in the grid as well as a sequence ofdistinctcells $$$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots (a_p, b_p)$$$ ($$$p \ge 2$$$) such that the following conditions hold:
Then, he/she removes $$$c$$$ from the grid and adds 1 token to $$$(a_2, b_2), (a_3, b_3), \ldots (a_p, b_p)$$$ each. This concludes his/her turn.
The player who cannot make a turn loses. Mimo goes first. Determine who will win if both players play optimally.
For example, consider a game where $$$n=6$$$, $$$m=4$$$, and 3 tokens currently exist in $$$(2, 3)$$$, $$$(4, 2)$$$, and $$$(6, 4)$$$ (as shown in Figure 1). In this scenario, a valid turn, for instance, could consist of choosing $$$c$$$ as the token in $$$(6, 4)$$$ and the sequence of cells with $$$p=10$$$ defined by $$$a=[6,6,5,4,3,2,2,3,4,4]$$$ and $$$b=[4,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,1]$$$. Note that $$$(a_i, b_i)$$$ describes valid cells in the grid.
For the sake of clarity, a dashed line is shown in Figure 2 passing through this particular choice of $$$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots (a_p, b_p)$$$ in order. Figure 3 and 4 show the state of the game after the turn is performed, with and without the highlighted sequence respectively.
Note that the first and seventh test case in the example correspond to the games shown in Figure 1 and Figure 4 respectively.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).
The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$k$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i \le n, 1 \le y_i \le m$$$).
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.
Note that there is no explicit upper bound on the sum of $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$.

## Output
For each test case, outputMimoif Mimo wins, orYuyuif Yuyu wins.
You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the stringsmIMo,mimo,Mimo, andMIMOwill be recognized as responses indicating that the first player wins.
