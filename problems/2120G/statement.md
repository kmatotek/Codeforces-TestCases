# Problem Description


Aryan loves graph theory more than anything. Well, no, he likes to flex his research paper on line graphs to everyone more. To start a conversation with you, he decides to give you a problem on line graphs. In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, the line graph of a simple undirected graph $$$G$$$ is another simple undirected graph $$$L(G)$$$ that represents the adjacency between every two edges in $$$G$$$.
Precisely speaking, for an undirected graph $$$G$$$ without self-loops or multiple edges, its line graph $$$L(G)$$$ is a graph such that
Also, $$$L^0(G)=G$$$ and $$$L^k(G)=L(L^{k-1}(G))$$$ for $$$k\geq 1$$$.
An Euler trail is a sequence of edges that visits every edge of the graph exactly once. This trail can be either a path (starting and ending at different vertices) or a cycle (starting and ending at the same vertex). Vertices may be revisited during the trail, but each edge must be used exactly once.
Aryan gives you a simple connected graph $$$G$$$ with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges and an integer $$$k$$$, and it is guaranteed that $$$G$$$ has an Euler trail and it is not a path graph$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$. He asks you to determine if $$$L^k(G)$$$ has an Euler trail.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A path graph is a tree where every vertex is connected to atmost two other vertices.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$5 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$n-1 \le m \le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n-1)}{2} ,2 \cdot 10^5)$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).
The next $$$m$$$ lines of each test case contain two space-separated integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u,v \le n$$$, $$$u \neq v$$$), denoting that an edge connects vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each testcase, print "YES" if $$$L^k(G)$$$ has an Euler trail; otherwise, "NO".
You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
