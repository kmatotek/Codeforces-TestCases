# Problem Description


Consider the following problem statement:
You are given a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices rooted at $$$1$$$. For each $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$, a car will enter the root at time $$$l_i$$$. It will then instantaneously travel from the root to vertex $$$i$$$ through the unique simple path and park there. It will leave through the same path in the other direction at time $$$r_i$$$.
During the time when a car is parked in a vertex, it blocks other cars from traveling through that vertex. The tree is calledvalidif and only if all cars are able to enter and leave the tree at their desired times.
Count the number of pairs of sequences $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ such that $$$l_i < r_i$$$, their concatenation is a permutation of $$$1 \ldots 2n$$$, and the tree is valid.
Calculate the sum of the answers to the problem over all labeled trees$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$k$$$ leaves. The root is not considered a leaf. Since the answer may be large, calculate it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$Two labeled trees are considered different if and only if their edge sets are different.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq k < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices and leaves of the tree, respectively.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output one integer — the answer modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.
