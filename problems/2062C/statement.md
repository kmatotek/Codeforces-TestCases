# Problem Description

Cirno has a sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. She can perform either of the following two operations for any (possibly, zero) timesunlessthe current length of $$$a$$$ is $$$1$$$:
Find the maximum possible sum of elements of $$$a$$$ after all operations.

## Input
The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of input test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 50$$$) — the length of sequence $$$a$$$.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$|a_i|\le 1000$$$) — the sequence $$$a$$$.

## Output
For each test case, print an integer representing the maximum possible sum.
