# Problem Description

You are given two non-negative integers $$$a, b$$$. You can apply two types of operations on $$$a$$$ any number of times and in any order:
Now you are asked to make $$$a = b$$$. If it's possible, output the minimum cost; otherwise, report it.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains four integers $$$a, b, x, y$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le 100, 1 \le x, y \le 10^7$$$) — the two integers given to you and the respective costs of two types of operations.

## Output
For each test case, output an integer — the minimum cost to make $$$a = b$$$, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.
