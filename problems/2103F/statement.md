# Problem Description


The bitwise nor$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of an array of $$$k$$$-bit integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ can be computed by calculating the bitwise nor cumulatively from left to right. More formally, $$$\operatorname{nor}(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m) = \operatorname{nor}(\operatorname{nor}(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{m - 1}), b_m)$$$ for $$$m\ge 2$$$, and $$$\operatorname{nor}(b_1) = b_1$$$.
You are given an array of $$$k$$$-bit integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. For each index $$$i$$$ ($$$1\le i\le n$$$), find the maximum bitwise nor among all subarrays$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of $$$a$$$ containing index $$$i$$$. In other words, for each index $$$i$$$, find the maximum value of $$$\operatorname{nor}(a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r)$$$ among all $$$1 \le l \le i \le r \le n$$$.
$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ Thelogical norof two boolean values is $$$1$$$ if both values are $$$0$$$, and $$$0$$$ otherwise. The bitwise nor of two $$$k$$$-bit integers is calculated by performing the logical nor operation on each pair of the corresponding bits.
For example, let us compute $$$\operatorname{nor}(2, 6)$$$ when they are represented as $$$4$$$-bit numbers. In binary, $$$2$$$=$$$0010_2$$$ and $$$6=0110_2$$$. Therefore, $$$\operatorname{nor}(2,6) = 1001_2 = 9$$$ as by performing the logical nor operations from left to right, we have:
Note that if $$$2$$$ and $$$6$$$ were represented as $$$3$$$-bit integers instead, then $$$\operatorname{nor}(2,6) = 1$$$.
$$$^{\text{†}}$$$An array $$$x$$$ is a subarray of an array $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 17$$$) — the number of elements in the array and the number of bits of the array elements.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 2^k - 1$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers, the $$$i$$$-th of which is the maximum bitwise nor among all subarrays of $$$a$$$ containing index $$$i$$$.
