# Problem Description


You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. Also, you are given three variables $$$P,Q,R$$$, initially equal to zero.
You need to process all the numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$,in the order from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. When processing the next $$$a_i$$$, you must performexactlyone of the three actions of your choice:
$$$\oplus$$$ denotes thebitwise XOR operation.
When performing actions, you must follow themain rule: it is necessary that after each action, all three numbers $$$P,Q,R$$$ arenotpairwise distinct.
There are a total of $$$3^n$$$ ways to perform all $$$n$$$ actions. How many of them do not violate themain rule? Since the answer can be quite large, find it modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.
The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.
It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output the number of ways to perform all $$$n$$$ actions without violating themain rule, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.
