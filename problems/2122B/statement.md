# Problem Description


You are given $$$n$$$ binary piles, the $$$i$$$-th of which consists of $$$a_i$$$ zeros on the top and $$$b_i$$$ ones on the bottom.
In one operation, you can take thetop elementof any pile and move it to any position in any pile, including the pile it was taken from.

## Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of piles.
Then $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th containing four integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, $$$c_i$$$, $$$d_i$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the original and target state of the $$$i$$$-th pile.
It is guaranteed that there exists a sequence of operations that transforms the piles into the target state.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output
For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of operations required to achieve the target state.
